    "### The hippy_chat handler module\n",
    "This is the source for our chat handler. A few things to note:\n",
    "* [arrow](http://crsmithdev.com/arrow/) is a really nice datetime replacement. _I recommend using this or [pendulum](https://github.com/sdispater/pendulum) for **all** cases where you work with datetimes_\n",
    "* [py-buzz](https://github.com/dusktreader/py-buzz) is one of my packages that provides some nice add-ons to python exceptions\n",
    "* [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) is an awesome package for working with apis. It's dead simple to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also worth noting: This is a logging handler for normal python logging. This is what our project started using a long time ago. Python logging is pretty cool, but _it is not as cool as it could or should be. These days, I try to use [logbook](https://github.com/getlogbook/logbook) wherever possible_. However, logbook is not a drop-in replacement, so our project will probably stick with vanilla logging for now...or maybe forever"
